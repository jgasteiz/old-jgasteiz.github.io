    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been long since last time I posted some music. Well, here is the first track of Rush&rsquo;s 2112, great album I&rsquo;ve discovered not long ago.</p>

<p>Give the album a go if you have a change, it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>God, it&rsquo;s been a busy June.</p>

<p>A whole week living outside my flat, new and exciting projects which required some <a href="http://angularjs.org/">formation at home</a> and&hellip; some <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=real%20world&amp;defid=176772">other things with higher priority than writing here</a>. But here I am again, bringing <strong>great</strong> news from the psychedelic side of life :)</p>

<p>Causa Sui is releasing a new LP this August! I&rsquo;ve missed them a lot since their awesome <a href="http://www.causasui.com/releases.html">Pewt'r Sessions</a>, which Vinyl I got last Desertfest (2011), but fortunately here they come again.</p>

<p>And here are the two tracks they&rsquo;ve published in their SoundCloud account. Enjoy!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Prologue</strong></p>

<p>Take a look at last year&rsquo;s post, <a href="/das-ist-berlin/">Das ist Berlin</a>. And also <a href="/desertfest-more-stuff/">Desertfest &ndash; more stuff</a></p>

<p><strong>This year</strong></p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been in the same hostel and festival. Both of them were awesome and we couldn&rsquo;t come up with a better idea for spending a few days together. Great live concerts (less than the last year, though), new places we&rsquo;ve visited and lots of beer we&rsquo;ve drunk.</p>

<em>Ishtar Gate &ndash; Pergamon Museum</em></p>

<em>Having massive lunch on a typical german restaurant</em></p>

<em>Blues Pills</em></p>

<em>Yawning Man</em></p>

<em>Berliner Kindl &ndash; my favorite</em></p>

<p><img src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-o8mut6iIDY0/UXzOnna-xpI/AAAAAAAAHbQ/nTx1AN79M68/s960/IMG_20130427_234747.jpg" alt="" /><br/>

<em>Love</em></p>

<p>And much more that will remain in my mind for years.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s time to rest now. Tomorrow I&rsquo;ll be part of London&rsquo;s heartbeat again and I must <em>beat</em> properly.</p>

<p>Say what you need to say<br/>
Make it clear<br/>
Make it great<br/>
Cause it’s not too late<br/>
And there’s no mistake<br/>
When you shine<br/>
Shake it for me anyway<br/>
Now we crash the gate<br/>
To investigate<br/>
Your fate</p>

<p>Pleasure to meet you<br/>
Got so much more<br/>
To offer the world<br/>
See what’s in store<br/>
Stay all day<br/>
Someone to love<br/>
That’s my boy chip chop<br/>
Open the doors<br/>
And we never close shop<br/>
Stay all day</p>

<p>Take what you need to take<br/>
To forsake<br/>
Make it for me anyway<br/>
When we fill the void<br/>
That is <strong style="color: #DD24BF;">Pink As Floyd</strong><br/>
To destroy<br/>
Records that we file away<br/>
And I’ll clean the slate<br/>
As I calculate<br/>
Your fate</p>

<p>Pleasure to meet you<br/>
Got so much more<br/>
To offer the world<br/>
See what’s in store<br/>
Stay all day<br/>
Someone to love<br/>
That’s my boy chip chop<br/>
Open the doors<br/>
And we never close shop<br/>
Stay all day</p>

<p>And you shine as you redefine<br/>
Your time, just another time of day<br/>
Do you feel the spark<br/>
When you play the part<br/>
Superstar<br/>
Fake it for me anyway<br/>
Time to tell them all<br/>
Without hem or haw<br/>
No applause<br/>
Tell them how to generate<br/>
How to raise the bar<br/>
How to keep it hard<br/>
To be alive, make it for me anyway<br/>
If you care at all<br/>
You will bare it all<br/>
You will grind, shake it for me anyway<br/>
Born to play the part<br/>
Dying for your art<br/>
Cuz it’s time<br/>
Take it for me anyway<br/>
You will clear the air<br/>
With a single stare<br/>
Your fate</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8364/8342367280_e2edb34945_o.png" title="nomad" alt="Nomadic Pursuits Cover" /></p>

<p>This picture is part of Yawning Man&rsquo;s last album cover, <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-x3gv-U9deWI/Tj8d8wR8VOI/AAAAAAAABFk/xihwaQHkCdI/s1600/Yawning%2BMan%2B-%2B2010%2B-%2BNomadic%2BPursuits.jpg" title="nomadic pursuits">Nomadic Pursuits</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Nomadic life</strong></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been almost six years since I started living away from home and I&rsquo;ve had the feeling of not belonging anywhere for all of these years. I&rsquo;ve lived in seven or eight different places since then and I spend only a few weeks per year in Vitoria. I guess I don&rsquo;t want to belong anywhere. Someone could tell I am looking for something, moving this much, I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ll figure it out someday.</p>

<p><strong>Desert</strong></p>

<p>Furthermore, it&rsquo;s also related to the desert. The desert rock is the music genre Yawning Man invented back in the eighties-nineties. In terms of <em>desert</em>, it could describe most of the stuff I&rsquo;ve had in my mind these last years: how I&rsquo;ve behaved and felt with myself and most of the times with other people. The desert could be very warm during the day but it gets really cold at night. That&rsquo;s a close description of how I&rsquo;ve been since I moved away from home. And somehow, the desert reminds loneliness too.</p>

<p><strong>Why now?</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://sp6.fotolog.com/photo/6/12/46/javitheskater/1212073336_f.jpg" title="ah">The first tattoo I&rsquo;ve ever thought about</a> was six years ago, during my first months at university. I had the design completely worked out, but I never took a step forward and actually did it. And it&rsquo;s something I regret now. That one meant my adolescence, those amazing years in Vitoria with all my friends, partying and playing music. After moving to London, I knew I was closing another stage in my life and it felt like the right time for doing this.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>This picture completely describes the last and closer stage in my life. I couldn&rsquo;t be comfortable with something which will try to describe the present or even the future. This is what it has been, not what it is or it will be.</p>
