God, it's been a busy June.

A whole week living outside my flat, new and exciting projects which required some [formation at home](http://angularjs.org/) and... some [other things with higher priority than writing here](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=real%20world&defid=176772). But here I am again, bringing **great** news from the psychedelic side of life :)

Causa Sui is releasing a new LP this August! I've missed them a lot since their awesome [Pewt'r Sessions](http://www.causasui.com/releases.html), which Vinyl I got last Desertfest (2011), but fortunately here they come again.

And here are the two tracks they've published in their SoundCloud account. Enjoy!
