Today will be the last night in my current flat, the place where I've probably spent more time during the last 12 months. Sanctuary for watching films, playing games, lazing, sleeping and, sometimes, working.

On Saturday morning I will regret things like having a guitar or heavy books. Every time I've bought something during the last year I've thought for a while on the moving one day I would have to do and how much I would hate myself for that. It didn't make buy less.

The good thing about this bookself is that it represents most of the things I've done and places I've visited during this year. It's not shown in the picture, but some Russian souvenirs live in the lowest shelf.

Kindles might be a perfect substitute for most of the books in the market, but I still believe there is nothing like paper when we talk about reference or programming books. Flipping pages >>> pressing buttons.

I don't have time for writing more, there are a few bags that need to be filled with stuff. Wish me luck.
