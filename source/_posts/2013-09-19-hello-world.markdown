This is the first post of this new blog I've decided to create. It's going to be called _Fuzzopress_, like the bloging application I developed in Django for my personal blog, [Fuzzing the Web](http://fuzzingtheweb.com). It makes even more sense now, since this is pure Octopress - I want to give static blogs a go.

Since I already write about random stuff in my personal blog, I'll focus this one on Web Development. There is no Web Development content today, but I'll probably start writing something about CSS transitions one of these days. It's what it's keeping me awake for the last couple of weeks.

And since I'm a xkcd lover, let's close this first post with a funny strip.
