    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m so tired of looking for posts about jumping/deleting words and jumping between the beginning and the end of the line in iTerm2, that I&rsquo;ve decided to write my own post.</p>

<h3>Word jumping &ndash; with <em>option + left/right</em></h3>

<ul>
<li>Go to iTerm preferences &ndash;> &ldquo;your default profile&rdquo; &ndash;> Keys</li>
<li>get rid of the lines with the two lines sending escape codes with <em>option + left/right</em></li>
<li>Add a couple of lines in iTerm preferences &ndash;> Keys (Global Shortcut keys)

<ul>
<li><em>option + left</em>: Send Escape Sequence, ESC + B</li>
<li><em>option + right</em>: Send Escape Sequence, ESC + F</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Word deletion &ndash; with <em>option + backspace</em></h3>

<p>Add a line in iTerm preferences &ndash;> Keys (Global Shortcut keys):</p>

<ul>
<li><em>option + backspace</em>: Send Hex Code, 0x1B 0x08</li>
</ul>


<h3>Jump to the beginning/end of a line &ndash; with <em>cmd + left/right</em></h3>

<p>Add a couple of lines in iTerm preferences &ndash;> Keys (Global Shortcut keys):</p>

<ul>
<li><em>cmd + left</em>: Send Hex Code, 0x01</li>
<li><em>cmd + right</em>: Send Hex Code, 0x05</li>
</ul>


<p>Check the following screenshot for more details:</p>

    <updated>2014-05-02T09:29:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://fuzzingtheweb.com/blog/2014/05/02/oh-the-irony</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve recently moved to a new flat. The fact that I love most about it is that I don&rsquo;t have neighbours. Well, almost.</p>

<p>The flat is the top floor of a big house, which ground and first floors are used by a charity. So we technically have neighbours from Monday to Friday, 9 to 5.</p>

<p>One of the requirements for living in my current flat was having a clean criminal history, at least clean in all matters related with children &ndash; the charity is for children with disabilities. To check our criminal records we had to go through a short interview with one of the charity workers and fill in some forms. Not a big deal.</p>

<p>One of the questions you get to answer in this interview is &ldquo;what do you do for a living&rdquo;. When I told the guy I was a web developer, he raised his eyebrows and said something like &ldquo;oh, that&rsquo;s cool! We could actually use some help with our website here, we&rsquo;re having some trouble getting some stuff working properly&rdquo;. I told him I&rsquo;d be happy to help. It&rsquo;s always good to have a nice relationship with your neighbours.</p>

<p>The weeks went by and we moved in. Of course, we didn&rsquo;t have internet in place, so I thought I could ask them for <em>some</em> and offer my help with their website, regardless they could give me access to their internet or not. I wrote a friendly email asking for internet to the guy I met during my interview and he raised the query to his supervisor. Then I realised that this charity probably worked as any other company out there and they probably couldn&rsquo;t just share their internet that easily. Pretty understandable, that&rsquo;s how things work.</p>

<p>I was right about that, they couldn&rsquo;t give me internet because they manage private and important data, <em>bla bla bla</em> &ndash; I was expecting it. But, here comes the irony, they also can&rsquo;t accept my help for the same reason. Doesn&rsquo;t it sound stupid? I&rsquo;d like to help a charity doing one of the few things I know how to do right and they just can&rsquo;t accept my help.</p>

<p>But who can blame them, they are only following rules there. They seem nice people and because we&rsquo;ll be in the building at different times during the day, I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll get to be good neighbours.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The year is 2044. The Great Recession, the one we have now, is still there and a huge energy crisis has joined it. Real Life™ sucks, but fortunately there is a virtual reality, much better than reality itself, called OASIS. And the access is free.</p>

<p>One day, the creator of this OASIS dies and leaves a last will: he has hidden 3 keys or <em>Easter Eggs</em> in the OASIS and the one who finds the three of them, will inherit all his fortune and the control of the OASIS.</p>

<p>After that happens loads of people, gunters from now on &ndash; Egg hunters &ndash;, will start looking for the keys. The creator of the OASIS was known to be a fanatic of the 80s pop culture and in order to understand the riddles he left behind and find the keys, every gunter will have to become an expert in the matter.</p>

<p>The book is full of references to videogames, movies, books, comic books, more videogames, tv series and everything you can imagine from the 80s. So everyone who still remembers how the 80s were or even the early 90s, will probably enjoy this book.</p>

    <id>http://fuzzingtheweb.com/blog/2014/01/03/back-for-christmas</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m back here since this Monday morning, that&rsquo;s one of the few and vague reasons I haven&rsquo;t written in a few days. That and Christmas excitement. New year&rsquo;s eve has been brutal this year. I can&rsquo;t remember a night as epic as this year&rsquo;s has been, hard to believe. Specially because I don&rsquo;t usually enjoy new year&rsquo;s eve at all.</p>

<p>I brought the new camera to Spain and I&rsquo;ve some time to spend learning the basics about it. After reading some book introductions and blog posts, I&rsquo;ve got a common message from all of them: I should try to make tons of pictures. Apparently &ldquo;learning by doing&rdquo; is the best way of learning. Good stuff. I&rsquo;ve also started uploading some of them to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jgasteiz/">my flickr account</a>.</p>

<p><em>A couple of seconds of shutter speed in the darkness of my bedroom made the trick.</em></p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3822/11719225215_4f406bfc08_z.jpg" alt="vinyl" /></p>

<p><em>After reading one of the first chapters of <a href="http://www.ppsop.com/unex.aspx">Understanding Exposure, by Bryan Peterson</a>, I had the feeling of trying something the book explained about playing with values for getting cool exposures. For getting this, I&rsquo;ve also changed some stuff in Lightroom.</em></p>

<p><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5516/11778545294_2c581dece4_z.jpg" alt="from my window" /></p>

<p>A tripod was used for both pictures, I got a cheap one the other day &ndash; I know, I know, none recommends cheap tripods. But I&rsquo;m definitely not spending a lot on a tripod now, and 12 euros seemed quite reasonable for what I got. Better that than nothing, right?</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s all folks.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A couple of days ago I found in some spanish blog &ndash; I can&rsquo;t find the source, sorry &ndash; a comparison between how the USA government promotes learning to code and how the spanish government tries (not very hard though) to do the same thing.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the american approach:</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="360" src="http://fuzzingtheweb.com//www.youtube.com/embed/FC5FbmsH4fw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>They even have a site about it, <a href="http://code.org/">code.org</a></p>

<p>And here&rsquo;s the spanish approach:</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="360" src="http://fuzzingtheweb.com//www.youtube.com/embed/4tZQtU8QiiY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>Pay attention to the code he&rsquo;s working on.</p>

<p><img src="http://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-f_CzM1J-0c4/UqsPZ9rd0bI/AAAAAAAANOw/uk9NDR-8CoA/w641-h390-no/Screen+Shot+2013-12-13+at+13.44.13.png" alt="Some piece of shit" /></p>

<p>And if anyone is interested, they guy says something like &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a programmer&rdquo; at the beginning and &ldquo;I studied programming in X place&rdquo;. Not relevant. Or maybe it is, in case you were thinking on studying there.</p>

<p>It feels like they don&rsquo;t want us to learn :(</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today will be the last night in my current flat, the place where I&rsquo;ve probably spent more time during the last 12 months. Sanctuary for watching films, playing games, lazing, sleeping and, sometimes, working.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2866/11342901484_931b7d029c_z.jpg" alt="My desk and bookshelf" /></p>

<p>On Saturday morning I will regret things like having a guitar or heavy books. Every time I&rsquo;ve bought something during the last year I&rsquo;ve thought for a while on the moving one day I would have to do and how much I would hate myself for that. It didn&rsquo;t make buy less.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7364/11342899124_b614ff504d_z.jpg" alt="Berlin is a bitch, and then you marry. Nice souvenir I bought in a shop in Kreuzberg" /></p>

<p>The good thing about this bookself is that it represents most of the things I&rsquo;ve done and places I&rsquo;ve visited during this year. It&rsquo;s not shown in the picture, but some Russian souvenirs live in the lowest shelf.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7407/11342785855_f7b3f45506_z.jpg" alt="Books I've bought during this year" /></p>

<p>Kindles might be a perfect substitute for most of the books in the market, but I still believe there is nothing like paper when we talk about reference or programming books. Flipping pages >>> pressing buttons.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have time for writing more, there are a few bags that need to be filled with stuff. Wish me luck.</p>

<li><p>did anyone else had the feeling that Steve Jobs (and Jonathan Ive) got extremely caricatured? They looked more like programmed machines to follow one or two behaviours than humans! I still can&rsquo;t understand how Wozniak could put up with him for more than half of the movie.</p></li>
<li><p>again, <em>Steve Jobs&#8217;</em> way of facing problems seemed so unhuman. It&rsquo;s well known he was a &ldquo;special&rdquo; guy for not being the nicest boss / father ever, but I would feel quite offended if anyone pictured me in a film like this. I&rsquo;d feel offended if he was my family or friend, I think.</p></li>
<li><p>have they put all Apple commercials together as a script for Jonathan Ive&rsquo;s role? They made him look like a weirdo. Once more, I&rsquo;d feel offended if I was him.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Apart from this, the film was fine. Entertaining, although I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s not worthy paying much for watching it :/</p>

<p>I give it two thirds of a star out of two stars. Because weird roles deserve weird ratings.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I&rsquo;ve been trying to run <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-glue">grunt-glue</a> in my Elementary OS and after trying to understand why it wasn&rsquo;t running, I realised the JPEG/ZLIB support weren&rsquo;t working.</p>

<p>It usually happens when you install PIL via pip. To fix the issue, do the following:</p>

<p>Uninstall PIL from your virtualenv &ndash; please, use <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv">virtualenv</a>.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>pip uninstall PIL</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Install PIL dependencies &ndash; and python-dev, if you don&rsquo;t have it installed.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>sudo apt-get build-dep python-imaging
</span><span class='line'>sudo apt-get install python-dev</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Create a few symbolic links and install PIL again. When you install PIL, do it with a -U argument to see some output of the installation. I&rsquo;ve noticed the sources for 32bit installations would change to <em>i386-linux-gnu</em> instead of <em>x86_64linux-gnu</em>.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libjpeg.so /usr/lib
</span><span class='line'>sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libfreetype.so /usr/lib
</span><span class='line'>sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libz.so /usr/lib
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>pip install -U PIL</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If everything went fine, you shoould see something like this if you scroll up a bit:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>--------------------------------------------------------------------
</span><span class='line'>PIL 1.1.7 SETUP SUMMARY
</span><span class='line'>--------------------------------------------------------------------
</span><span class='line'>version       1.1.7
</span><span class='line'>platform      linux2 2.7.3 (default, Apr 10 2013, 06:20:15)
</span><span class='line'>              [GCC 4.6.3]
</span><span class='line'>--------------------------------------------------------------------
</span><span class='line'>*** TKINTER support not available
</span><span class='line'>--- JPEG support available
</span><span class='line'>--- ZLIB (PNG/ZIP) support available
</span><span class='line'>--- FREETYPE2 support available
</span><span class='line'>*** LITTLECMS support not available
</span><span class='line'>--------------------------------------------------------------------</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Another option, instead of creating those links manually, would be installing PIL in the machine python installation.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>sudo apt-get install python-imaging</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And another option, although not what you were looking for, would be installing Pillow &ndash; which is a better PIL, basically.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>pip install Pillow</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>After any of these 3 options you should be able to use the python imaging library happily now.</p>

<p>PS: Thanks everyone for the corrections and suggestions for this post ;)</p>
