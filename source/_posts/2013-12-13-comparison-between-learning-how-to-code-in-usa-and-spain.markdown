A couple of days ago I found in some spanish blog - I can't find the source, sorry - a comparison between how the USA government promotes learning to code and how the spanish government tries (not very hard though) to do the same thing.

Here's the american approach:

They even have a site about it, [code.org](http://code.org/)

And here's the spanish approach:

Pay attention to the code he's working on.

And if anyone is interested, they guy says something like "I'm a programmer" at the beginning and "I studied programming in X place". Not relevant. Or maybe it is, in case you were thinking on studying there.

It feels like they don't want us to learn :(
