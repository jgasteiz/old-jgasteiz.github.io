This is an awesome initiative by [www.code.org](http://www.code.org/ "code.org").

After watching this video, I've immediately remembered my days at uni. We were a few people in class and I could easily say that not even half of us were really interested in this field. In doing stuff at our own, in learning new things in general. And I recognise I was quite lost during my first two years there (laziness maybe?), but when the third year came and I started discovering, learning and playing... everything started to make sense.

It's fun, really! Getting paid for coding is like getting paid for playing with LEGO. I have reasons for being happy, I guess :)

Too bad I'm not _great_. Yet. :P
