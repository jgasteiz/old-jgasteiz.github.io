The adventurers - an adventurer is missing, but this is one of the few pictures in which I'm ok.

We managed to enjoy the night life - once. And we saw the typical russian fight! One guy fighting half naked, almost til death.

Paranoid Matryoshka - in some market, can't remember where.

Unfortunately for us, our girls got bored. Luckily for us, it didn't go any further from there.

Our carriage was the best one. There we are with the staff of the carriage, having beers and cigars, like proper gentlemen.

And before we realise, it's time to come back to London.

It's been awesome, really. A couple of amazing weeks with great people, discovering incredible places. I'd like to do something similar next year.
