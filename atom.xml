    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The year is 2044. The Great Recession, the one we have now, is still there and a huge energy crisis has joined it. Real Life™ sucks, but fortunately there is a virtual reality, much better than reality itself, called OASIS. And the access is free.</p>

<p>One day, the creator of this OASIS dies and leaves a last will: he has hidden 3 keys or <em>Easter Eggs</em> in the OASIS and the one who finds the three of them, will inherit all his fortune and the control of the OASIS.</p>

<p>After that happens loads of people, gunters from now on &ndash; Egg hunters &ndash;, will start looking for the keys. The creator of the OASIS was known to be a fanatic of the 80s pop culture and in order to understand the riddles he left behind and find the keys, every gunter will have to become an expert in the matter.</p>

<p>The book is full of references to videogames, movies, books, comic books, more videogames, tv series and everything you can imagine from the 80s. So everyone who still remembers how the 80s were or even the early 90s, will probably enjoy this book.</p>

    <id>http://fuzzingtheweb.com/blog/2014/01/03/back-for-christmas</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m back here since this Monday morning, that&rsquo;s one of the few and vague reasons I haven&rsquo;t written in a few days. That and Christmas excitement. New year&rsquo;s eve has been brutal this year. I can&rsquo;t remember a night as epic as this year&rsquo;s has been, hard to believe. Specially because I don&rsquo;t usually enjoy new year&rsquo;s eve at all.</p>

<p>I brought the new camera to Spain and I&rsquo;ve some time to spend learning the basics about it. After reading some book introductions and blog posts, I&rsquo;ve got a common message from all of them: I should try to make tons of pictures. Apparently &ldquo;learning by doing&rdquo; is the best way of learning. Good stuff. I&rsquo;ve also started uploading some of them to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jgasteiz/">my flickr account</a>.</p>

<p><em>A couple of seconds of shutter speed in the darkness of my bedroom made the trick.</em></p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3822/11719225215_4f406bfc08_z.jpg" alt="vinyl" /></p>

<p><em>After reading one of the first chapters of <a href="http://www.ppsop.com/unex.aspx">Understanding Exposure, by Bryan Peterson</a>, I had the feeling of trying something the book explained about playing with values for getting cool exposures. For getting this, I&rsquo;ve also changed some stuff in Lightroom.</em></p>

<p><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5516/11778545294_2c581dece4_z.jpg" alt="from my window" /></p>

<p>A tripod was used for both pictures, I got a cheap one the other day &ndash; I know, I know, none recommends cheap tripods. But I&rsquo;m definitely not spending a lot on a tripod now, and 12 euros seemed quite reasonable for what I got. Better that than nothing, right?</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s all folks.</p>

<p>I just can&rsquo;t help stopping a movie I&rsquo;m watching everytime I see a scene in which someone is typing something. I&rsquo;m always looking forward to finding stuff like this.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A couple of days ago I found in some spanish blog &ndash; I can&rsquo;t find the source, sorry &ndash; a comparison between how the USA government promotes learning to code and how the spanish government tries (not very hard though) to do the same thing.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the american approach:</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="360" src="http://fuzzingtheweb.com//www.youtube.com/embed/FC5FbmsH4fw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>They even have a site about it, <a href="http://code.org/">code.org</a></p>

<p>And here&rsquo;s the spanish approach:</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="360" src="http://fuzzingtheweb.com//www.youtube.com/embed/4tZQtU8QiiY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>Pay attention to the code he&rsquo;s working on.</p>

<p><img src="http://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-f_CzM1J-0c4/UqsPZ9rd0bI/AAAAAAAANOw/uk9NDR-8CoA/w641-h390-no/Screen+Shot+2013-12-13+at+13.44.13.png" alt="Some piece of shit" /></p>

<p>And if anyone is interested, they guy says something like &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a programmer&rdquo; at the beginning and &ldquo;I studied programming in X place&rdquo;. Not relevant. Or maybe it is, in case you were thinking on studying there.</p>

<p>It feels like they don&rsquo;t want us to learn :(</p>

    <id>http://fuzzingtheweb.com/blog/2013/12/12/another-flat-goes-away</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today will be the last night in my current flat, the place where I&rsquo;ve probably spent more time during the last 12 months. Sanctuary for watching films, playing games, lazing, sleeping and, sometimes, working.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2866/11342901484_931b7d029c_z.jpg" alt="My desk and bookshelf" /></p>

<p>On Saturday morning I will regret things like having a guitar or heavy books. Every time I&rsquo;ve bought something during the last year I&rsquo;ve thought for a while on the moving one day I would have to do and how much I would hate myself for that. It didn&rsquo;t make buy less.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7364/11342899124_b614ff504d_z.jpg" alt="Berlin is a bitch, and then you marry. Nice souvenir I bought in a shop in Kreuzberg" /></p>

<p>The good thing about this bookself is that it represents most of the things I&rsquo;ve done and places I&rsquo;ve visited during this year. It&rsquo;s not shown in the picture, but some Russian souvenirs live in the lowest shelf.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7407/11342785855_f7b3f45506_z.jpg" alt="Books I've bought during this year" /></p>

<p>Kindles might be a perfect substitute for most of the books in the market, but I still believe there is nothing like paper when we talk about reference or programming books. Flipping pages >>> pressing buttons.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have time for writing more, there are a few bags that need to be filled with stuff. Wish me luck.</p>

<p>The film was ok, but</p>

<ul>
<li><p>did anyone else had the feeling that Steve Jobs (and Jonathan Ive) got extremely caricatured? They looked more like programmed machines to follow one or two behaviours than humans! I still can&rsquo;t understand how Wozniak could put up with him for more than half of the movie.</p></li>
<li><p>again, <em>Steve Jobs&#8217;</em> way of facing problems seemed so unhuman. It&rsquo;s well known he was a &ldquo;special&rdquo; guy for not being the nicest boss / father ever, but I would feel quite offended if anyone pictured me in a film like this. I&rsquo;d feel offended if he was my family or friend, I think.</p></li>
<li><p>have they put all Apple commercials together as a script for Jonathan Ive&rsquo;s role? They made him look like a weirdo. Once more, I&rsquo;d feel offended if I was him.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Apart from this, the film was fine. Entertaining, although I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s not worthy paying much for watching it :/</p>

<p>I give it two thirds of a star out of two stars. Because weird roles deserve weird ratings.</p>

    <link href="http://fuzzingtheweb.com/blog/2013/09/26/installing-pil-on-ubuntu-based-distributions/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-26T21:09:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://fuzzingtheweb.com/blog/2013/09/26/installing-pil-on-ubuntu-based-distributions</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I&rsquo;ve been trying to run <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-glue">grunt-glue</a> in my Elementary OS and after trying to understand why it wasn&rsquo;t running, I realised the JPEG/ZLIB support weren&rsquo;t working.</p>

<p>It usually happens when you install PIL via pip. To fix the issue, do the following:</p>

<p>Uninstall PIL from your virtualenv &ndash; please, use <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv">virtualenv</a>.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>pip uninstall PIL</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Install PIL dependencies &ndash; and python-dev, if you don&rsquo;t have it installed.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>sudo apt-get build-dep python-imaging
</span><span class='line'>sudo apt-get install python-dev</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Create a few symbolic links and install PIL again. When you install PIL, do it with a -U argument to see some output of the installation. I&rsquo;ve noticed the sources for 32bit installations would change to <em>i386-linux-gnu</em> instead of <em>x86_64linux-gnu</em>.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libjpeg.so /usr/lib
</span><span class='line'>sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libfreetype.so /usr/lib
</span><span class='line'>sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libz.so /usr/lib
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>pip install -U PIL</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If everything went fine, you shoould see something like this if you scroll up a bit:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>--------------------------------------------------------------------
</span><span class='line'>PIL 1.1.7 SETUP SUMMARY
</span><span class='line'>--------------------------------------------------------------------
</span><span class='line'>version       1.1.7
</span><span class='line'>platform      linux2 2.7.3 (default, Apr 10 2013, 06:20:15)
</span><span class='line'>              [GCC 4.6.3]
</span><span class='line'>--------------------------------------------------------------------
</span><span class='line'>*** TKINTER support not available
</span><span class='line'>--- JPEG support available
</span><span class='line'>--- ZLIB (PNG/ZIP) support available
</span><span class='line'>--- FREETYPE2 support available
</span><span class='line'>*** LITTLECMS support not available
</span><span class='line'>--------------------------------------------------------------------</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Another option, instead of creating those links manually, would be installing PIL in the machine python installation.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>sudo apt-get install python-imaging</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And another option, although not what you were looking for, would be installing Pillow &ndash; which is a better PIL, basically.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>pip install Pillow</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>After any of these 3 options you should be able to use the python imaging library happily now.</p>

<p>Also, not all of the old content of Fuzzing the Web will be here. At the beginning, I&rsquo;ll make an effort to migrate my favourite blog posts, but they will be only a few. I&rsquo;ll keep migrating posts little by little, until one day I&rsquo;ll be done.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll also work hard on keeping all the content properly categorised.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s close this first post of this new blog with some <em>classic</em> fun :)</p>

The adventurers &ndash; an adventurer is missing, but this is one of the few pictures in which I&rsquo;m ok.</p>

We managed to enjoy the night life &ndash; once. And we saw the typical russian fight! One guy fighting half naked, almost til death.</p>

    <updated>2013-07-01T23:48:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://fuzzingtheweb.com/blog/2013/07/01/young-qualified-and-jobless</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jul/01/jobless-europe-young-qualified">this article</a> in my way back home, which was in the home page of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/">The Guardian UK</a>. Sad feelings, sad stories. Close and familiar.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have many friends that have left Spain because of the crisis. I&rsquo;m actually the only one who has done that in my group of friends of Vitoria (my hometown). And the crisis wasn&rsquo;t my main reason for leaving, to be honest, but that&rsquo;s a story for another post. But yeah, I can see many of <em>us</em> walking everyday through the streets of London, talking Spanish to each other, some of them going back home after work, others carrying CVs from one place to another.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when I hear a conversation in Spanish in the tube I usually turn off my music and pay attention. Back in Spain, that would be being gossip, but I don&rsquo;t have that feeling here.</p>

<p>The other day for instance, I was listening to a couple of guys talking in the tube. For their accent, I&rsquo;d say they were from Madrid. One of them was apparently doing quite good. He was happy with his salary and he could even save money, something very uncommon between the spaniard community here, taking into account that most of us work as waiters, kitchen porters and other positions that don&rsquo;t require special qualification. But the other one wasn&rsquo;t that happy. I couldn&rsquo;t get what his job was, but he wasn&rsquo;t happy with it at all. He sounded a bit desperate and nervous. Anyway, I don&rsquo;t want to guess.</p>

<p>Is it always the fault of the politicians? Well, I agree the ones we have in Spain are in their majority shameless idiots. But I think it&rsquo;s most a matter of none knowing how to fix this.</p>

<p>I remember a conversation I had in my last year of high school with a friend. We were rambling about how the future would be, regarding employment (an advanced topic for a high school conversation maybe? :/ ). What both of us were wondering was how different would be the future employment, after so many technological advances. And we knew nothing, back then in 2007, because since then this has gone way further. Basically, the question we were asking ourselves was: <em>Does the world really need so many working people?</em></p>

<p>Back then, both of us thought that if the unemployment was so high is basically because there are no jobs for everyone, plain and simple. Stuff like travel agencies, estate agencies (in Spain, probably the 70% of them are gone), music stores, media stores, cinemas, post offices&hellip; all of them seem from a past age. And many more to come.</p>

<p>What we used to say, without giving proper arguments, is that the human race is getting to a point in which we shouldn&rsquo;t work that much. But the established economy model isn&rsquo;t prepared for that yet. I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll see some kind of global economy reorganization within ten years. I would like to see it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s always a pleasure and a bit sad going back to Vitoria for a few days. One part of me, wants to stay there. Another part wants to come back. But I always manage to get moments like these, lucky me!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>God, it&rsquo;s been a busy June.</p>

<p>A whole week living outside my flat, new and exciting projects which required some <a href="http://angularjs.org/">formation at home</a> and&hellip; some <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=real%20world&amp;defid=176772">other things with higher priority than writing here</a>. But here I am again, bringing <strong>great</strong> news from the psychedelic side of life :)</p>

<p>Causa Sui is releasing a new LP this August! I&rsquo;ve missed them a lot since their awesome <a href="http://www.causasui.com/releases.html">Pewt&#8217;r Sessions</a>, which Vinyl I got last Desertfest (2011), but fortunately here they come again.</p>

<p>And here are the two tracks they&rsquo;ve published in their SoundCloud account. Enjoy!</p>
