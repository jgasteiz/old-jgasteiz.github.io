    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve recently moved to a new flat. The fact that I love most about it is that I don&rsquo;t have neighbours. Well, almost.</p>

<p>The flat is the top floor of a big house, which ground and first floors are used by a charity. So we technically have neighbours from Monday to Friday, 9 to 5.</p>

<p>One of the requirements for living in my current flat was having a clean criminal history, at least clean in all matters related with children &ndash; the charity is for children with disabilities. To check our criminal records we had to go through a short interview with one of the charity workers and fill in some forms. Not a big deal.</p>

<p>One of the questions you get to answer in this interview is &ldquo;what do you do for a life&rdquo;. When I told the guy I was a web developer, he raised his eyebrows and said something like &ldquo;oh, that&rsquo;s cool! We could actually use some help with our website here, we&rsquo;re having some trouble getting some stuff working properly&rdquo;. I told him I&rsquo;ll be happy to help. It&rsquo;s always good to have a nice relationship with your neighbours.</p>

<p>The weeks went by and we moved in. Of course, we didn&rsquo;t have internet in place, so I thought I could ask them for <em>some</em> and offering my help with their website, regardless they could give me internet or not. I wrote a friendly email asking for internet to the guy I met during my interview and he raised to his supervisor. Then I realised that this charity probably worked as any other company out there and they probably couldn&rsquo;t just share their internet that easily. Pretty understandable, that&rsquo;s how things work.</p>

<p>I was right about that, they couldn&rsquo;t give me internet because they manage private and important data, <em>bla bla bla</em> &ndash; I was expecting it. But, here comes the irony, they also can&rsquo;t accept my help for the same reason. Doesn&rsquo;t it sound stupid? I&rsquo;d like to help a charity with one of the few things I know how to do right and they just can&rsquo;t accept my help.</p>

<p>But who can blame them, they are only following rules there. They seem nice people and because we&rsquo;ll be in the building at different times during the day, I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll get to be good neighbours.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A bit late, but better late than never &ndash; my birthday was on the 11th of January. Great dinner full of meat in Putney&rsquo;s <a href="http://rodiziopreto.co.uk/">Rodizio Preto</a> followed by a massive ale ingest in the closest wetherspoons and finished by more beer in a local club. Nothing fancy, that&rsquo;s why it ruled.</p>

<p>And I got amazing presents! This beer crafting kit between them :)</p>
