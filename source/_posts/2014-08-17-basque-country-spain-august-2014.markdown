I'm back to London after a great (and a bit deserved) holiday around the Basque Country and Spain for ten days. It could have been more, but it's been enough to rest and forget about routine, I think.

The trip begins and ends in [Vitoria-Gasteiz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitoria_Gasteiz), my hometown. We arrive in the middle of [Fiestas de la Blanca](http://englishidiotabroad.blogspot.co.uk/2007/10/spain-11-fiestas-de-la-virgen-blanca-4.html). We were lucky enough to see my friends [Countach](http://countach.bandcamp.com/) playing live!

The next day we need to get up soon because we're **blusas** for a day. I used to do this for the entire festivity years ago, but since I moved to London it's not a easy to do as it used to be - it would require getting 5 days of holiday plus a few extra days only for recorvery.

And [an extra video](https://plus.google.com/+JaviManzano/posts/Xka8jzx7jBW?pid=6048524182394566594&oid=104971241169939266087) to show the general mood of that morning.

The weather wasn't the best I've seen there during August, but we managed to stay out of rain for the entire holiday.

After a quick visit to Donostia-San Sebastian, we moved south to Molacillos (Zamora), the village where my father was raised. Chorizo, cheese, red wine and jam√≥n were part of the spanish therapy we got there. Exquisite way of getting rid of stress.

The holiday is getting to an end and we want to say goodbye the proper way, with a massive BBQ with all my friends. We got so much food for lunch, we had dinner with the leftovers. And we still got bread left for today's breakfast.
