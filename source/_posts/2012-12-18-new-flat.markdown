Just moved today into a new flat. This one feels like home, actually. I will (finally) be able to reduce my amount of daily public transport and only take two tubes instead of bus+train+tube every single day. It was exhausting and annoying.

Here are some pictures from my new place.

First one is the living room, from where I'm seated right now. The picture doesn't show the real size of the room, which is quite big. More pictures coming when we get the TV ;)

This one is the kitchen. Small but cozy.

The last one is my bedroom. I guess it's extremely small compared to the other ones. I should have chosen tails :(

And after a huge dosis of Tuesday pizza, it's bedtime.
