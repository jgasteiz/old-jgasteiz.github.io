I was coming home tonight when I've seen a guy playing this song at Picadilly Circus tube station. A big smile has come to my face and it has definitely made my day.

This is not the first time I write about The Waterboys in this blog. Last time, same song, was in January: [Fisherman's Bluest - The Waterboys](http://fuzzingtheweb.com/fishermans-blues-the-waterboys/ "old post")
