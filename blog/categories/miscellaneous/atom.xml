<p>The film was ok, but</p>

<ul>
<li><p>did anyone else had the feeling that Steve Jobs (and Jonathan Ive) got extremely caricatured? They looked more like programmed machines to follow one or two behaviours than humans! I still can&rsquo;t understand how Wozniak could put up with him for more than half of the movie.</p></li>
<li><p>again, <em>Steve Jobs'</em> way of facing problems seemed so unhuman. It&rsquo;s well known he was a &ldquo;special&rdquo; guy for not being the nicest boss / father ever, but I would feel quite offended if anyone pictured me in a film like this. I&rsquo;d feel offended if he was my family or friend, I think.</p></li>
<li><p>have they put all Apple commercials together as a script for Jonathan Ive&rsquo;s role? They made him look like a weirdo. Once more, I&rsquo;d feel offended if I was him.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Apart from this, the film was fine. Entertaining, although I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s not worthy paying much for watching it :/</p>

<p>I give it two thirds of a star out of two stars. Because weird roles deserve weird ratings.</p>

    <id>http://jgasteiz.github.io/blog/2013/07/01/young-qualified-and-jobless</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jul/01/jobless-europe-young-qualified">this article</a> in my way back home, which was in the home page of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/">The Guardian UK</a>. Sad feelings, sad stories. Close and familiar.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have many friends that have left Spain because of the crisis. I&rsquo;m actually the only one who has done that in my group of friends of Vitoria (my hometown). And the crisis wasn&rsquo;t my main reason for leaving, to be honest, but that&rsquo;s a story for another post. But yeah, I can see many of <em>us</em> walking everyday through the streets of London, talking Spanish to each other, some of them going back home after work, others carrying CVs from one place to another.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when I hear a conversation in Spanish in the tube I usually turn off my music and pay attention. Back in Spain, that would be being gossip, but I don&rsquo;t have that feeling here.</p>

<p>The other day for instance, I was listening to a couple of guys talking in the tube. For their accent, I&rsquo;d say they were from Madrid. One of them was apparently doing quite good. He was happy with his salary and he could even save money, something very uncommon between the spaniard community here, taking into account that most of us work as waiters, kitchen porters and other positions that don&rsquo;t require special qualification. But the other one wasn&rsquo;t that happy. I couldn&rsquo;t get what his job was, but he wasn&rsquo;t happy with it at all. He sounded a bit desperate and nervous. Anyway, I don&rsquo;t want to guess.</p>

<p>Is it always the fault of the politicians? Well, I agree the ones we have in Spain are in their majority shameless idiots. But I think it&rsquo;s most a matter of none knowing how to fix this.</p>

<p>I remember a conversation I had in my last year of high school with a friend. We were rambling about how the future would be, regarding employment (an advanced topic for a high school conversation maybe? :/ ). What both of us were wondering was how different would be the future employment, after so many technological advances. And we knew nothing, back then in 2007, because since then this has gone way further. Basically, the question we were asking ourselves was: <em>Does the world really need so many working people?</em></p>

<p>Back then, both of us thought that if the unemployment was so high is basically because there are no jobs for everyone, plain and simple. Stuff like travel agencies, estate agencies (in Spain, probably the 70% of them are gone), music stores, media stores, cinemas, post offices&hellip; all of them seem from a past age. And many more to come.</p>

<p>What we used to say, without giving proper arguments, is that the human race is getting to a point in which we shouldn&rsquo;t work that much. But the established economy model isn&rsquo;t prepared for that yet. I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll see some kind of global economy reorganization within ten years. I would like to see it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s always a pleasure and a bit sad going back to Vitoria for a few days. One part of me, wants to stay there. Another part wants to come back. But I always manage to get moments like these, lucky me!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I read this post a couple of days ago and I have to say I concur in most of the points with the writer. Most of the reasons he talks about are the reasons why I blog. Not to make myself advertisement (at all), or because I have nothing better to do. Actually, most of the last posts I&rsquo;ve written are quite short because I have plenty of better things to do. For me is as recreational as reading a good book.</p>

<p>But yeah, as <em>Nathan Marz</em> says,  you should blog because it&rsquo;s good for you. You have very little to loose and a lot to win, such as intelligence! Well, not really, but it does help a lot making you think before talking and in a more organised way, in general.</p>

<p>And for me, that was only when I used to write in spanish. Now I&rsquo;m even practising english! Very little to loose, indeed.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been a <em>museums</em> weekend and for the first time in months, we&rsquo;ve had warm weather in London. Since yesterday. I might recover part of my natural tan before August!</p>

<p>And I also haven&rsquo;t touch a keyboard during the weekend, which is cool. It&rsquo;s been some kind of disconnection weekend, something I&rsquo;m enjoying quite a lot lately. Anyway, I will probably compensate touching too much keyboard during this whole week, as usual.</p>
