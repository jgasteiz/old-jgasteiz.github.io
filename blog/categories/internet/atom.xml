    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Funny moment when you are watching a science fiction movie and you realise a guy &ndash; William Fichtner &ndash; who is doing some work on his computer is actually programming assembler. Nice one, but taking into account the story is set in 2154, it seems a bit too much.</p>

<p>I just can&rsquo;t help stopping a movie I&rsquo;m watching everytime I see a scene in which someone is typing something. I&rsquo;m always looking forward to finding stuff like this.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A couple of days ago I found in some spanish blog &ndash; I can&rsquo;t find the source, sorry &ndash; a comparison between how the USA government promotes learning to code and how the spanish government tries (not very hard though) to do the same thing.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the american approach:</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="360" src="http://fuzzingtheweb.com//www.youtube.com/embed/FC5FbmsH4fw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>They even have a site about it, <a href="http://code.org/">code.org</a></p>

<p>And here&rsquo;s the spanish approach:</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="360" src="http://fuzzingtheweb.com//www.youtube.com/embed/4tZQtU8QiiY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>Pay attention to the code he&rsquo;s working on.</p>

<p>And if anyone is interested, they guy says something like &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a programmer&rdquo; at the beginning and &ldquo;I studied programming in X place&rdquo;. Not relevant. Or maybe it is, in case you were thinking on studying there.</p>

<p>It feels like they don&rsquo;t want us to learn :(</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t have any time for writing short updates like this once in a while, it&rsquo;s just I&rsquo;ve been a bit busy during the last week: reading, living, <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sofing" title="sofing">sofing</a>, surfing the interweb. I&rsquo;ve also started working in a different project at work, which has meant more voluntary reading when arriving at home. It might sound hard, but I&rsquo;m really enjoying it.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s something I want to write about: <em>what kind of things do you share online?</em> Yeah, I know it&rsquo;s not a hot topic after months/years of debate around it. But maybe because of that, right now seems the perfect moment for asking yourself what kind of stuff do you share online and with who. I&rsquo;m not talking about being careful about pedophiles, posting pictures of yourself doing hard drugs or uploading your last amateur porn movie. Let&rsquo;s forget about those topics and think about something much simpler.</p>

<p><strong>Why do we share stuff online</strong></p>

<p>Well, obviously because we think someone cares about it. And I&rsquo;m sure the 99% of the people doesn&rsquo;t care at all about the 99% of the updates they read in facebook, for example. And I truly believe that around 80% of those people know that fact. Even though, we keep updating. Why? We are fascinating creatures.</p>

<p><strong>What kind of stuff do you share online?</strong></p>

<p>Personal stuff? Professional stuff? Nothing at all? <em>All the things</em>?</p>

<p>People can think I write in this blog because I like writing (I do, by the way. At least I enjoy trying). Or because I want to show the world how cool I am because I have a blog (really, it&rsquo;s so hard having a blog these days! :P). Or maybe because I want to show future employers that I can keep side projects alive. Or maybe because I need psychological assistance and I&rsquo;ve realised it&rsquo;s cheaper rambling in a blog than paying a psychologist. Or simply because I want to keep some record of my thoughts, using the blog like some sort of diary.</p>

<p>Those are real questions I&rsquo;ve already asked to myself and I&rsquo;ve got interesting answers. Which I won&rsquo;t share here, by the way. As a conclusion, I realised I&rsquo;ve also changed a lot my way of sharing stuff in the internet during these last years. I guess we all grow up, even in the internet.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Another -and maybe the main- reason why apart from <em>just writing</em> in this blog, I am doing it in english: I need to improve my english. Really, if you want to improve a language (English, Spanish, Python, JavaScript), there is only one way of doing it: practising. Which means speaking/reading/writing.</p>

<p>Here, some pictures from the weekend.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;ll close the post with this AWESOME video showing the quick-sort algorithm with a hungarian folk dance.</p>
