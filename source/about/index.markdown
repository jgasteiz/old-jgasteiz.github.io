My name is Javi Manzano and I am a Web Developer.

I do both backend and frontend, but I'm mainly focused on the frontend. I work for a web development agency called [Potato](http://p.ota.to/) based in London where we build awesome websites, some of them with a big traffic. If you want to take a look to the kind of stuff we build there, take a look at the [work section in Potato's website](http://p.ota.to/work/).

Here's a brief description of the stuff I do:

### Libraries and Frameworks

- **[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)** - One of my most successful discoveries, it has changed the way I feel about web development. I'm still a newbie in Django, but I also believe that I am capable of everything with it.
- **[SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)** - I can't remember the last time I didn't use a CSS preprocessor for styling a website. How could something called Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets not be awesome?
- **[Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/)** - After working months with Django, I had the need of learning how to give a proper organization to my JavaScript. That's where Backbone.js came in. Backbone.js is my prefered client side framework.
- **[AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/)** - When you need plenty of event bindings everywhere and you need to get something fast, AngularJS comes in and makes everything simpler. Forget about coding the same render function a hundred times, extend your HTML markup and dominate the interwebs with AngularJS.
- **[Grunt - The Javascript Task Runner](http://gruntjs.com/)** - This one is new for me. I'm still learning things every day I have to play with it, but the general feeling about it is satisfaction, power and success.

### Prefered deployment environments

- **[Google Appengine](https://developers.google.com/appengine/)** - Super easy to use, scale and magage. It has become the deployment environment I've used most.
- **[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)** - Not that I have used it a lot, but it's always useful for some quick prototypes and personal projects.
- **[Linode](https://www.linode.com/)** - Although I've used Amazon Web Services more than Linode, I'm always using Linode now every time I need to put my hands on any unix server.

### Contact me

I'm @jgasteiz in [twitter](https://twitter.com/jgasteiz) and [github](https://github.com/jgasteiz). For a more personal approach feel free to send me an email to javi.manzano.oller at gmail.

Before sending any email, please know that I'm not interested on changing my current position, no matter how awesome the offer is. I'm currently where I want to be and if at some point I want to change my job, I'll probably remove this paragraph from here.
