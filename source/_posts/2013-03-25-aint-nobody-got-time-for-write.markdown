Well, it's not that I don't have any time for writing short updates like this once in a while, it's just I've been a bit busy during the last week: reading, living, [sofing](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sofing "sofing"), surfing the interweb. I've also started working in a different project at work, which has meant more voluntary reading when arriving at home. It might sound hard, but I'm really enjoying it.

Here's something I want to write about: _what kind of things do you share online?_ Yeah, I know it's not a hot topic after months/years of debate around it. But maybe because of that, right now seems the perfect moment for asking yourself what kind of stuff do you share online and with who. I'm not talking about being careful about pedophiles, posting pictures of yourself doing hard drugs or uploading your last amateur porn movie. Let's forget about those topics and think about something much simpler.

**Why do we share stuff online**

Well, obviously because we think someone cares about it. And I'm sure the 99% of the people doesn't care at all about the 99% of the updates they read in facebook, for example. And I truly believe that around 80% of those people know that fact. Even though, we keep updating. Why? We are fascinating creatures.

**What kind of stuff do you share online?**

Personal stuff? Professional stuff? Nothing at all? _All the things_?

People can think I write in this blog because I like writing (I do, by the way. At least I enjoy trying). Or because I want to show the world how cool I am because I have a blog (really, it's so hard having a blog these days! :P). Or maybe because I want to show future employers that I can keep side projects alive. Or maybe because I need psychological assistance and I've realised it's cheaper rambling in a blog than paying a psychologist. Or simply because I want to keep some record of my thoughts, using the blog like some sort of diary.

Those are real questions I've already asked to myself and I've got interesting answers. Which I won't share here, by the way. As a conclusion, I realised I've also changed a lot my way of sharing stuff in the internet during these last years. I guess we all grow up, even in the internet.

**UPDATE**: Another -and maybe the main- reason why apart from _just writing_ in this blog, I am doing it in english: I need to improve my english. Really, if you want to improve a language (English, Spanish, Python, JavaScript), there is only one way of doing it: practising. Which means speaking/reading/writing.

Here, some pictures from the weekend.

And I'll close the post with this AWESOME video showing the quick-sort algorithm with a hungarian folk dance.
