I was warned about Truckfighters going out of tune last week in Vitoria, but as far as I know they've done it pretty well today at The Underworld. Except for _Atomic_, in which guitar, bass and voice were completely out of tune. The voice has been the weakest thing, but making a good balance in general taking into account the brutality of the drums, guitar and bass.

And the mosh pit has been massive. Liters of sweat, people bleeding from their noses and jumping from the stage every ten seconds... absolutely amazing. Can't remember anything similar, even in Berlin Desertfest.

PD: at the end of the concert we were barely able to breathe. Huge lack of oxygen. The Underworld people should fix that.
