    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today will be the last night in my current flat, the place where I&rsquo;ve probably spent more time during the last 12 months. Sanctuary for watching films, playing games, lazing, sleeping and, sometimes, working.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2866/11342901484_931b7d029c_z.jpg" alt="My desk and bookshelf" /></p>

<p>On Saturday morning I will regret things like having a guitar or heavy books. Every time I&rsquo;ve bought something during the last year I&rsquo;ve thought for a while on the moving one day I would have to do and how much I would hate myself for that. It didn&rsquo;t make buy less.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7364/11342899124_b614ff504d_z.jpg" alt="Berlin is a bitch, and then you marry. Nice souvenir I bought in a shop in Kreuzberg" /></p>

<p>The good thing about this bookself is that it represents most of the things I&rsquo;ve done and places I&rsquo;ve visited during this year. It&rsquo;s not shown in the picture, but some Russian souvenirs live in the lowest shelf.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7407/11342785855_f7b3f45506_z.jpg" alt="Books I've bought during this year" /></p>

<p>Kindles might be a perfect substitute for most of the books in the market, but I still believe there is nothing like paper when we talk about reference or programming books. Flipping pages >>> pressing buttons.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have time for writing more, there are a few bags that need to be filled with stuff. Wish me luck.</p>

<p>The film was ok, but</p>

<ul>
<li><p>did anyone else had the feeling that Steve Jobs (and Jonathan Ive) got extremely caricatured? They looked more like programmed machines to follow one or two behaviours than humans! I still can&rsquo;t understand how Wozniak could put up with him for more than half of the movie.</p></li>
<li><p>again, <em>Steve Jobs&#8217;</em> way of facing problems seemed so unhuman. It&rsquo;s well known he was a &ldquo;special&rdquo; guy for not being the nicest boss / father ever, but I would feel quite offended if anyone pictured me in a film like this. I&rsquo;d feel offended if he was my family or friend, I think.</p></li>
<li><p>have they put all Apple commercials together as a script for Jonathan Ive&rsquo;s role? They made him look like a weirdo. Once more, I&rsquo;d feel offended if I was him.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Apart from this, the film was fine. Entertaining, although I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s not worthy paying much for watching it :/</p>

<p>I give it two thirds of a star out of two stars. Because weird roles deserve weird ratings.</p>

    <link href="http://jgasteiz.github.io/blog/2013/09/26/installing-pil-on-ubuntu-based-distributions/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-26T21:09:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://jgasteiz.github.io/blog/2013/09/26/installing-pil-on-ubuntu-based-distributions</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I&rsquo;ve been trying to run <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-glue">grunt-glue</a> in my Elementary OS and after trying to understand why it wasn&rsquo;t running, I realised the JPEG/ZLIB support weren&rsquo;t working.</p>

<p>It usually happens when you install PIL via pip. To fix the issue, do the following:</p>

<p>Uninstall PIL from your virtualenv &ndash; please, use <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv">virtualenv</a>.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>pip uninstall PIL</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Install PIL dependencies &ndash; and python-dev, if you don&rsquo;t have it installed.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>sudo apt-get build-dep python-imaging
</span><span class='line'>sudo apt-get install python-dev</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Create a few symbolic links and install PIL again. When you install PIL, do it with a -U argument to see some output of the installation. I&rsquo;ve noticed the sources for 32bit installations would change to <em>i386-linux-gnu</em> instead of <em>x86_64linux-gnu</em>.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libjpeg.so /usr/lib
</span><span class='line'>sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libfreetype.so /usr/lib
</span><span class='line'>sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libz.so /usr/lib
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>pip install -U PIL</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If everything went fine, you shoould see something like this if you scroll up a bit:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>--------------------------------------------------------------------
</span><span class='line'>PIL 1.1.7 SETUP SUMMARY
</span><span class='line'>--------------------------------------------------------------------
</span><span class='line'>version       1.1.7
</span><span class='line'>platform      linux2 2.7.3 (default, Apr 10 2013, 06:20:15)
</span><span class='line'>              [GCC 4.6.3]
</span><span class='line'>--------------------------------------------------------------------
</span><span class='line'>*** TKINTER support not available
</span><span class='line'>--- JPEG support available
</span><span class='line'>--- ZLIB (PNG/ZIP) support available
</span><span class='line'>--- FREETYPE2 support available
</span><span class='line'>*** LITTLECMS support not available
</span><span class='line'>--------------------------------------------------------------------</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Another option, instead of creating those links manually, would be installing PIL in the machine python installation.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>sudo apt-get install python-imaging</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And another option, although not what you were looking for, would be installing Pillow &ndash; which is a better PIL, basically.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>pip install Pillow</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>After any of these 3 options you should be able to use the python imaging library happily now.</p>

<p>PS: Thanks everyone for the corrections and suggestions for this post ;)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll write about the same random things I used to write about before, but I&rsquo;ll try to write better stuff.</p>

<p>Also, not all of the old content of Fuzzing the Web will be here. At the beginning, I&rsquo;ll make an effort to migrate my favourite blog posts, but they will be only a few. I&rsquo;ll keep migrating posts little by little, until one day I&rsquo;ll be done.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll also work hard on keeping all the content properly categorised.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s close this first post of this new blog with some <em>classic</em> fun :)</p>

    <updated>2013-07-01T23:48:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://jgasteiz.github.io/blog/2013/07/01/young-qualified-and-jobless</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jul/01/jobless-europe-young-qualified">this article</a> in my way back home, which was in the home page of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/">The Guardian UK</a>. Sad feelings, sad stories. Close and familiar.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have many friends that have left Spain because of the crisis. I&rsquo;m actually the only one who has done that in my group of friends of Vitoria (my hometown). And the crisis wasn&rsquo;t my main reason for leaving, to be honest, but that&rsquo;s a story for another post. But yeah, I can see many of <em>us</em> walking everyday through the streets of London, talking Spanish to each other, some of them going back home after work, others carrying CVs from one place to another.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when I hear a conversation in Spanish in the tube I usually turn off my music and pay attention. Back in Spain, that would be being gossip, but I don&rsquo;t have that feeling here.</p>

<p>The other day for instance, I was listening to a couple of guys talking in the tube. For their accent, I&rsquo;d say they were from Madrid. One of them was apparently doing quite good. He was happy with his salary and he could even save money, something very uncommon between the spaniard community here, taking into account that most of us work as waiters, kitchen porters and other positions that don&rsquo;t require special qualification. But the other one wasn&rsquo;t that happy. I couldn&rsquo;t get what his job was, but he wasn&rsquo;t happy with it at all. He sounded a bit desperate and nervous. Anyway, I don&rsquo;t want to guess.</p>

<p>Is it always the fault of the politicians? Well, I agree the ones we have in Spain are in their majority shameless idiots. But I think it&rsquo;s most a matter of none knowing how to fix this.</p>

<p>I remember a conversation I had in my last year of high school with a friend. We were rambling about how the future would be, regarding employment (an advanced topic for a high school conversation maybe? :/ ). What both of us were wondering was how different would be the future employment, after so many technological advances. And we knew nothing, back then in 2007, because since then this has gone way further. Basically, the question we were asking ourselves was: <em>Does the world really need so many working people?</em></p>

<p>Back then, both of us thought that if the unemployment was so high is basically because there are no jobs for everyone, plain and simple. Stuff like travel agencies, estate agencies (in Spain, probably the 70% of them are gone), music stores, media stores, cinemas, post offices&hellip; all of them seem from a past age. And many more to come.</p>

<p>What we used to say, without giving proper arguments, is that the human race is getting to a point in which we shouldn&rsquo;t work that much. But the established economy model isn&rsquo;t prepared for that yet. I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll see some kind of global economy reorganization within ten years. I would like to see it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s always a pleasure and a bit sad going back to Vitoria for a few days. One part of me, wants to stay there. Another part wants to come back. But I always manage to get moments like these, lucky me!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>God, it&rsquo;s been a busy June.</p>

<p>A whole week living outside my flat, new and exciting projects which required some <a href="http://angularjs.org/">formation at home</a> and&hellip; some <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=real%20world&amp;defid=176772">other things with higher priority than writing here</a>. But here I am again, bringing <strong>great</strong> news from the psychedelic side of life :)</p>

<p>Causa Sui is releasing a new LP this August! I&rsquo;ve missed them a lot since their awesome <a href="http://www.causasui.com/releases.html">Pewt&#8217;r Sessions</a>, which Vinyl I got last Desertfest (2011), but fortunately here they come again.</p>

    <updated>2013-05-20T23:48:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://jgasteiz.github.io/blog/2013/05/20/djangocon-eu-2013-warszawa</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is an entry I&rsquo;ve been writing during DjangoCon 2013, from several places: hotel bedroom, laying in the grass from DjangoCon, having a beer in some terrace in Warsaw, airplane and back in the office before starting Monday :)</p>

<h2>Friday, 17th May</h2>

<p>Dzień dobry from my hotel room (cloning repos at 30KiB/s). I&rsquo;m half-exhausted half-excited right now. We are having an awesome weather in Warsaw these days and somehow it charges my batteries. Has to be photosynthesis.</p>

<p>We arrived here  on Tuesday and after a proper afternoon rest, we headed to Stare Miasto to enjoy a bit the city. I managed to take these beautiful pics there.</p>

<p><img src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4gYG4VDaD48/UZKvDAINwhI/AAAAAAAAIYY/rYuEhgPIT9M/w1532-h517-no/PANO_20130514_192834.jpg" title="Stare Miasto" alt="Stare Miasto 1" /></p>

<p><img src="http://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-27IjArG1en4/UZKtfFUSraI/AAAAAAAAIXk/uw2es9HFsc0/w1533-h802-no/PANO_20130514_190623.jpg" title="Stare Miasto" alt="Stare Miasto 2" /></p>

<p>On Wednesday morning DjangoCon started. My first impression of the venue was that they had experimented <em>a lot</em> setting up a real circus and trusting a lot on the weather. But after spending a few minutes there I realised they couldn&rsquo;t have chosen a better venue.</p>

<p><img src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-PZkNfzT-HH4/UZOwCl0tHGI/AAAAAAAAIcU/bBWh6AloaDk/w1533-h843-no/PANO_20130515_082237.jpg" title="Django Circus" alt="DjangoCon" /></p>

<p>YES, it&rsquo;s a real circus. Here&rsquo;s a panorama view from the inside.</p>

<p><img src="http://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-8qbIetxxq_c/UZc01mFeMbI/AAAAAAAAIfg/qEi8PdRIMyc/w1535-h739-no/PANO_20130517_122733.jpg" alt="DjangoCon" /></p>

<p>Even thought I missed a few talks during the whole event, I met lots of great, wise and experienced developers/people.</p>

<p><strong>The food</strong>: Since DjangoCon started we&rsquo;ve managed to get pierogi, popcorn, sandwiches, beer, <em>scoops</em> of ice cream, fruit, coffee&hellip; everything by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bulka.spolka">Bulka i Spólka</a>. For sure, I can tell DjangoCon provided an environment that many other conferences would like to have. <strong>Well done</strong>.</p>

<h2>Saturday, 18th May</h2>

<p>To finish the <em>talkings</em>, <a href="http://sendgrid.com/">SendGrid</a> sponsored Friday&rsquo;s evening party. An awesome performance with the guitar by <a href="https://twitter.com/dN0t">Rob Spectre</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/brandon_rhodes">Brandon Rhodes</a> made the night and eventually we ran out of beer. Sometimes like these, I wish I had a proper camera with me to immortalise these kind of moments.</p>

<p><img src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XqBQCjOFfps/UZc1hq9hWWI/AAAAAAAAIhY/N7sL7U2D4bg/w1167-h875-no/IMG_20130517_215011.jpg" alt="Rob Spectre and Brandon Rhodes" /></p>

<p>Oh, and I also got a signed copy of <a href="https://django.2scoops.org/">Two Scoops of Django</a>! &ndash; A must read for every Django developer. I don&rsquo;t say this, it&rsquo;s said by many people.</p>

<p><img src="http://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-yDkh5eUoqgU/UZYMbaIWKXI/AAAAAAAAIfI/jtc5sPCuNHw/w656-h875-no/2013+-+1" alt="Two Scoops of Django" /></p>

<p>Hah and if you feel curious about the <em>famous</em> PhotoBooth in DjangoCon, take a look at this <a href="http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.578110078887020.1073741829.469934899704539&amp;type=1">public album in facebook</a>.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p><img src="http://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc1/486653_578113725553322_1655252040_n.jpg" alt="photobooth" /></p>

<h2>Sunday, 19th May</h2>

<p>The party is over. The sprints are over too. It&rsquo;s been huge, all of it. It&rsquo;s the first time I feel part of a community like this, it feels very nice. I didn&rsquo;t get any picture of the sprints, I was quite immersed in the code for both Saturday and Sunday.</p>

<p>During Saturday, I <em>tried</em> to contribute to Django project. I worked on a ticket (work still in progress) and from my side it wasn&rsquo;t that much contribution, but after the experience I&rsquo;m less afraid to pick any ticket now and work on them. It was something necessary in order to start contributing in a future.</p>

<p>I spent today&rsquo;s morning working on personal stuff, something I started coding for personal use (which I&rsquo;m already using, by the way) and I will release in a near future. But I don&rsquo;t want to talk about it yet. I will only say it has something to do with <em>learning</em> stuff. For now, only languages :p</p>

<h2>Monday, 20th May (already in the office)</h2>

<p>I think the guys in France will have very difficult to organise an event as awesome as this next year, but something else I&rsquo;ve learnt these days is: with hard work, motivation and love, you can achieve anything. So as long as next year&rsquo;s organisation works hard on getting an awesome DjangoCon, everything will be just fine.</p>

<p>Dziękuję for these awesome days, DjangoCon + Warsaw!!!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Prologue</strong></p>

<p>Take a look at last year&rsquo;s post, <a href="http://jgasteiz.github.io/das-ist-berlin/">Das ist Berlin</a>. And also <a href="http://jgasteiz.github.io/desertfest-more-stuff/">Desertfest &ndash; more stuff</a></p>

<p><strong>This year</strong></p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been in the same hostel and festival. Both of them were awesome and we couldn&rsquo;t come up with a better idea for spending a few days together. Great live concerts (less than the last year, though), new places we&rsquo;ve visited and lots of beer we&rsquo;ve drunk.</p>

<p>And much more that will remain in my mind for years.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I read this post a couple of days ago and I have to say I concur in most of the points with the writer. Most of the reasons he talks about are the reasons why I blog. Not to make myself advertisement (at all), or because I have nothing better to do. Actually, most of the last posts I&rsquo;ve written are quite short because I have plenty of better things to do. For me is as recreational as reading a good book.</p>

<p>But yeah, as <em>Nathan Marz</em> says,  you should blog because it&rsquo;s good for you. You have very little to loose and a lot to win, such as intelligence! Well, not really, but it does help a lot making you think before talking and in a more organised way, in general.</p>

<p>And for me, that was only when I used to write in spanish. Now I&rsquo;m even practising english! Very little to loose, indeed.</p>

<p>And I also haven&rsquo;t touch a keyboard during the weekend, which is cool. It&rsquo;s been some kind of disconnection weekend, something I&rsquo;m enjoying quite a lot lately. Anyway, I will probably compensate touching too much keyboard during this whole week, as usual.</p>

    <id>http://jgasteiz.github.io/blog/2013/03/25/aint-nobody-got-time-for-write</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t have any time for writing short updates like this once in a while, it&rsquo;s just I&rsquo;ve been a bit busy during the last week: reading, living, <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sofing" title="sofing">sofing</a>, surfing the interweb. I&rsquo;ve also started working in a different project at work, which has meant more voluntary reading when arriving at home. It might sound hard, but I&rsquo;m really enjoying it.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s something I want to write about: <em>what kind of things do you share online?</em> Yeah, I know it&rsquo;s not a hot topic after months/years of debate around it. But maybe because of that, right now seems the perfect moment for asking yourself what kind of stuff do you share online and with who. I&rsquo;m not talking about being careful about pedophiles, posting pictures of yourself doing hard drugs or uploading your last amateur porn movie. Let&rsquo;s forget about those topics and think about something much simpler.</p>

<p><strong>Why do we share stuff online</strong></p>

<p>Well, obviously because we think someone cares about it. And I&rsquo;m sure the 99% of the people doesn&rsquo;t care at all about the 99% of the updates they read in facebook, for example. And I truly believe that around 80% of those people know that fact. Even though, we keep updating. Why? We are fascinating creatures.</p>

<p><strong>What kind of stuff do you share online?</strong></p>

<p>Personal stuff? Professional stuff? Nothing at all? <em>All the things</em>?</p>

<p>People can think I write in this blog because I like writing (I do, by the way. At least I enjoy trying). Or because I want to show the world how cool I am because I have a blog (really, it&rsquo;s so hard having a blog these days! :P). Or maybe because I want to show future employers that I can keep side projects alive. Or maybe because I need psychological assistance and I&rsquo;ve realised it&rsquo;s cheaper rambling in a blog than paying a psychologist. Or simply because I want to keep some record of my thoughts, using the blog like some sort of diary.</p>

<p>Those are real questions I&rsquo;ve already asked to myself and I&rsquo;ve got interesting answers. Which I won&rsquo;t share here, by the way. As a conclusion, I realised I&rsquo;ve also changed a lot my way of sharing stuff in the internet during these last years. I guess we all grow up, even in the internet.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Another -and maybe the main- reason why apart from <em>just writing</em> in this blog, I am doing it in english: I need to improve my english. Really, if you want to improve a language (English, Spanish, Python, JavaScript), there is only one way of doing it: practising. Which means speaking/reading/writing.</p>

<p>Here, some pictures from the weekend.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-VXSvAXXgMKw/UU3IifvERuI/AAAAAAAAGB0/Jyx4OUCE54g/s550/IMG_20130323_152115.jpg" title="snow" alt="snow" /></p>

<p>And I&rsquo;ll close the post with this AWESOME video showing the quick-sort algorithm with a hungarian folk dance.</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="420" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/IQfa96aP7ow" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>If money didn&rsquo;t matter&hellip; I would probably do similar stuff to what I do now for a living, but much better. Better, because time wouldn&rsquo;t be an issue, so I could spend as much time as I needed/wanted for learning a particular technology, playing with it, feeling comfortable with it and doing stuff without worrying if someone will pay for it. Thank god I don&rsquo;t worry much about selling what I code, I don&rsquo;t like selling.</p>

<p>Hopefully, if I still have the same hobbies when I get retired (if I ever get retired) and my brain still works, I would love to do stuff just for passion.</p>

<p>But anyway, I&rsquo;m not complaining at all. I have loads of fun everyday coding at work, <em>playing with LEGO</em>. And these days I&rsquo;ve been able to play with <a href="http://backbonejs.org/" title="backbone"><em>new LEGOs</em></a>, so I&rsquo;m even happier.</p>

<h2>2nd part</h2>

<p>Very inspiring video I&rsquo;ve seen in <a href="http://blog.floqq.com/empresa/estas-haciendo-lo-que-te-apasiona-en-este-mismo-momento/" title="floqq blog">Floqq&rsquo;s Blog</a> (content in spanish). And I&rsquo;m posting this as a second part of the post of a couple of days ago, <a href="http://fuzzingtheweb.com/what-if-money-didnt-matter-alan-watts/" title="what if money didn't matter"><em>What if money didn&rsquo;t matter</em></a>.</p>

<p>On that post I told briefly, as usual, what I think I would be doing with my life if money didn&rsquo;t matter. And I said I would probably like to do the same thing I&rsquo;m doing right now, because I have the luck of enjoying my job. But I also believe that&rsquo;s something that depends on the individual, because I can recognise that coding has never been vocational for me. Actually, I didn&rsquo;t realise how much I enjoyed this whole thing until I was in third year of university, almost finishing my studies.</p>

<p>I would probably have enjoyed this much any other field of human knowledge, because that&rsquo;s how I am. Luckily for me, I think I have the ability of being curious about almost anything. If I had studied psychology (I considered it, actually), I would probably have got really into it. With the proper motivation, of course. And the same would have happened if I had studied physics, which was another option back in time. Anyway, I&rsquo;m sure I wouldn&rsquo;t be in London right now if I hadn&rsquo;t chosen Computer Engineering in that moment.</p>

<p>I guess I&rsquo;m the perfect person for choosing wrong in life, because somehow I usually find the bright side of everything. Let&rsquo;s call it optimism/<em>will to power</em>/whatever. What&rsquo;s the point of being unhappy? I mean, why should I be angry about random stuff, while there&rsquo;s probably something out there, reachable for me, that I could be enjoying right now? Isn&rsquo;t it easier and nicer trying to find what makes you happy? I truly think it&rsquo;s way easier.</p>

<p>Ok, enough rambling. What I am trying to say is: do whatever you want to do you with your live. Don&rsquo;t do what your parents want you to do, don&rsquo;t do what anyone expects you to do. Just go somewhere and meditate for a while. It won&rsquo;t be harmful. You might end up doing something crazy, but that&rsquo;s the point. Take risks, don&rsquo;t take them, just do whatever you feel. While being a bit reasonable, if possible. It&rsquo;s always better to regret something you&rsquo;ve done than something you haven&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>For example, writing this crappy post. Right now, it feels like a good idea. Tomorrow morning, it will probably not. But what I&rsquo;m supposed to do, delete it? No way.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been today, after finishing some uni paperwork. I&rsquo;m officially an engineer now, I can finally sing <em>the song</em>!</p>

<p>A 5-year part of my life has come to an end after signing this last documents. It&rsquo;s been nice, I won&rsquo;t say the opposite, but I&rsquo;m also happy it came to an end. I have plenty of new and exciting stuff to experience now :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is an awesome initiative by <a href="http://www.code.org/" title="code.org">www.code.org</a>.</p>

<p>After watching this video, I&rsquo;ve immediately remembered my days at uni. We were a few people in class and I could easily say that not even half of us were really interested in this field. In doing stuff at our own, in learning new things in general. And I recognise I was quite lost during my first two years there (laziness maybe?), but when the third year came and I started discovering, learning and playing&hellip; everything started to make sense.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s fun, really! Getting paid for coding is like getting paid for playing with LEGO. I have reasons for being happy, I guess :)</p>

<p>Too bad I&rsquo;m not <em>great</em>. Yet. :P</p>
