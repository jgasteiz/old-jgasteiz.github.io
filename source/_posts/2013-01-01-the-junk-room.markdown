Plugging in the external hard drive to the laptop is kind of the same thing as start looking for old stuff in your parents' house junk room.

This picture was taken on the 20something of December 2006, during the first (of two haha) After Hours concert. Six years ago and I still have that jumper. I guess my mom is right when she says I must throw lots of clothes away.

So yesterday I ran San Silvestre, some sort of solidarity run which takes place every 31 of December in a lot of cities and towns of Spain. They are usually short enough so many people are able to run it without trouble. It wasn't that easy for me, I guess, as I've only been running for two months. But it was fun. A lot of people were dressed in costumes, some of them running with their dogs, even pushing their children in baby buggies. The end was having fun and raising money.

And today is the most useless day in the whole year. There's nothing you can do, because everything's closed (at least in Spain). And there is also no energy for moving from home to other place. Completely useless. Hm, I believe I still have that picture's jumper somewhere in the junk room...yeah, I can't see a better thing to do today.
