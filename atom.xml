    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m back (alive!) from Amsterdam. A few weeks ago, some friends and I decided it could be fun to spend a weekend partying and discovering the city of Amsterdam. And it&rsquo;s been great.</p>

<h3>The canals</h3>

<p>One of the things people are scared about when they go with this kind of purposes to Amsterdam is falling to the canals. I&rsquo;m not aware if that&rsquo;s something that happens often, but it didn&rsquo;t happen to us. And I have to say they give a beautiful look to the city.</p>

<p><img src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-tjGhma4btMU/U6dq0X3duDI/AAAAAAAAPfM/LeszwHXrNAg/w845-h634-no/IMG_20140622_140932.jpg" alt="The canals" /></p>

<h3>Bicycles</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;d be very happy if we had in London half of the cycling paths we saw in Amsterdam. And it would be so cool if didn&rsquo;t live 12 miles away from the office&hellip; and if people here wouldn&rsquo;t drive in the wrong side. But that&rsquo;s a different story.</p>

<p><img src="http://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-H5gg4xw_QvQ/U6dqd600GsI/AAAAAAAAPeo/-h1NOoJ8a-Y/w845-h634-no/IMG_20140622_124530.jpg" alt="Bicycles" /></p>

<h3>The weather</h3>

<p>Like Matus said, <em>we don&rsquo;t realise how lucky we&rsquo;ve been with the weather</em> – or did we? Luckily enough, I was able to wear shorts every day and get some human being colour in my forehead. Which unfortunately, will run away during the following weeks.</p>

<p><img src="http://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-4G-XREQfvP8/U6gI3CAqANI/AAAAAAAAPg4/bQ5eCXWvSj4/w845-h634-no/IMG_20140622_195314.jpg" alt="The weather" /></p>

<h3>Wildlife</h3>

<p>It must be hard to believe when someone tells you he <em>saw several turtles on a tree, in Amsterdam</em>. Well, here&rsquo;s the proof. In top of this, add swans, ducks, several types of pidgeon-like birds, and maybe, an octopus – that&rsquo;s a joke from the trip.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-bPw_hCFRess/U6ifDwgk-3I/AAAAAAAAPiM/StcdWdzkGyY/w786-h590-no/IMG_20140622_171055.jpg" alt="Wildlife" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;d also mention our hostel, but since it was closer to a prison cell, I&rsquo;ll better skip it.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ll close the post here before getting into more detail, because I don&rsquo;t even know how legal or politically correct would be to write about it. I&rsquo;ll only say it&rsquo;s been awesome and I&rsquo;ll try to repeat the experience at some point in the future.</p>

    <id>http://fuzzingtheweb.com/blog/2014/05/13/iterm2-word-jumping</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m so tired of looking for posts about jumping/deleting words and jumping between the beginning and the end of the line in iTerm2, that I’ve decided to write my own post.</p>

<h3>Word jumping – with option + left/right</h3>

<ul>
<li>Go to iTerm preferences –> “your default profile” –> Keys</li>
<li>get rid of the lines with the two lines sending escape codes with option + left/right</li>
<li>Add a couple of lines in iTerm preferences –> Keys (Global Shortcut keys)

<ul>
<li>option + left: Send Escape Sequence, ESC + B</li>
<li>option + right: Send Escape Sequence, ESC + F</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Word deletion – with option + backspace</h3>

<p>Add a line in iTerm preferences –> Keys (Global Shortcut keys):</p>

<ul>
<li>option + backspace: Send Hex Code, 0x1B 0x08</li>
</ul>


<h3>Jump to the beginning/end of a line – with cmd + left/right</h3>

<p>Add a couple of lines in iTerm preferences –> Keys (Global Shortcut keys):</p>

<ul>
<li>cmd + left: Send Hex Code, 0x01</li>
<li>cmd + right: Send Hex Code, 0x05</li>
</ul>


<p>Check the following screenshot for more details:</p>

    <updated>2014-05-02T09:29:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://fuzzingtheweb.com/blog/2014/05/02/oh-the-irony</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve recently moved to a new flat. The fact that I love most about it is that I don&rsquo;t have neighbours. Well, almost.</p>

<p>The flat is the top floor of a big house, which ground and first floors are used by a charity. So we technically have neighbours from Monday to Friday, 9 to 5.</p>

<p>One of the requirements for living in my current flat was having a clean criminal history, at least clean in all matters related with children &ndash; the charity is for children with disabilities. To check our criminal records we had to go through a short interview with one of the charity workers and fill in some forms. Not a big deal.</p>

<p>One of the questions you get to answer in this interview is &ldquo;what do you do for a living&rdquo;. When I told the guy I was a web developer, he raised his eyebrows and said something like &ldquo;oh, that&rsquo;s cool! We could actually use some help with our website here, we&rsquo;re having some trouble getting some stuff working properly&rdquo;. I told him I&rsquo;d be happy to help. It&rsquo;s always good to have a nice relationship with your neighbours.</p>

<p>The weeks went by and we moved in. Of course, we didn&rsquo;t have internet in place, so I thought I could ask them for <em>some</em> and offer my help with their website, regardless they could give me access to their internet or not. I wrote a friendly email asking for internet to the guy I met during my interview and he raised the query to his supervisor. Then I realised that this charity probably worked as any other company out there and they probably couldn&rsquo;t just share their internet that easily. Pretty understandable, that&rsquo;s how things work.</p>

<p>I was right about that, they couldn&rsquo;t give me internet because they manage private and important data, <em>bla bla bla</em> &ndash; I was expecting it. But, here comes the irony, they also can&rsquo;t accept my help for the same reason. Doesn&rsquo;t it sound stupid? I&rsquo;d like to help a charity doing one of the few things I know how to do right and they just can&rsquo;t accept my help.</p>

<p>But who can blame them, they are only following rules there. They seem nice people and because we&rsquo;ll be in the building at different times during the day, I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll get to be good neighbours.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The year is 2044. The Great Recession, the one we have now, is still there and a huge energy crisis has joined it. Real Life™ sucks, but fortunately there is a virtual reality, much better than reality itself, called OASIS. And the access is free.</p>

<p>One day, the creator of this OASIS dies and leaves a last will: he has hidden 3 keys or <em>Easter Eggs</em> in the OASIS and the one who finds the three of them, will inherit all his fortune and the control of the OASIS.</p>

<p>After that happens loads of people, gunters from now on &ndash; Egg hunters &ndash;, will start looking for the keys. The creator of the OASIS was known to be a fanatic of the 80s pop culture and in order to understand the riddles he left behind and find the keys, every gunter will have to become an expert in the matter.</p>

<p>The book is full of references to videogames, movies, books, comic books, more videogames, tv series and everything you can imagine from the 80s. So everyone who still remembers how the 80s were or even the early 90s, will probably enjoy this book.</p>

    <updated>2014-01-03T01:22:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://fuzzingtheweb.com/blog/2014/01/03/back-for-christmas</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m back here since this Monday morning, that&rsquo;s one of the few and vague reasons I haven&rsquo;t written in a few days. That and Christmas excitement. New year&rsquo;s eve has been brutal this year. I can&rsquo;t remember a night as epic as this year&rsquo;s has been, hard to believe. Specially because I don&rsquo;t usually enjoy new year&rsquo;s eve at all.</p>

<p>I brought the new camera to Spain and I&rsquo;ve some time to spend learning the basics about it. After reading some book introductions and blog posts, I&rsquo;ve got a common message from all of them: I should try to make tons of pictures. Apparently &ldquo;learning by doing&rdquo; is the best way of learning. Good stuff. I&rsquo;ve also started uploading some of them to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jgasteiz/">my flickr account</a>.</p>

<p><em>A couple of seconds of shutter speed in the darkness of my bedroom made the trick.</em></p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3822/11719225215_4f406bfc08_z.jpg" alt="vinyl" /></p>

<p><em>After reading one of the first chapters of <a href="http://www.ppsop.com/unex.aspx">Understanding Exposure, by Bryan Peterson</a>, I had the feeling of trying something the book explained about playing with values for getting cool exposures. For getting this, I&rsquo;ve also changed some stuff in Lightroom.</em></p>

<p><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5516/11778545294_2c581dece4_z.jpg" alt="from my window" /></p>

<p>A tripod was used for both pictures, I got a cheap one the other day &ndash; I know, I know, none recommends cheap tripods. But I&rsquo;m definitely not spending a lot on a tripod now, and 12 euros seemed quite reasonable for what I got. Better that than nothing, right?</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s all folks.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A couple of days ago I found in some spanish blog &ndash; I can&rsquo;t find the source, sorry &ndash; a comparison between how the USA government promotes learning to code and how the spanish government tries (not very hard though) to do the same thing.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the american approach:</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="360" src="http://fuzzingtheweb.com//www.youtube.com/embed/FC5FbmsH4fw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>They even have a site about it, <a href="http://code.org/">code.org</a></p>

<p>And here&rsquo;s the spanish approach:</p>

<p>Pay attention to the code he&rsquo;s working on.</p>

<p>And if anyone is interested, they guy says something like &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a programmer&rdquo; at the beginning and &ldquo;I studied programming in X place&rdquo;. Not relevant. Or maybe it is, in case you were thinking on studying there.</p>

<p>It feels like they don&rsquo;t want us to learn :(</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today will be the last night in my current flat, the place where I&rsquo;ve probably spent more time during the last 12 months. Sanctuary for watching films, playing games, lazing, sleeping and, sometimes, working.</p>

<p>On Saturday morning I will regret things like having a guitar or heavy books. Every time I&rsquo;ve bought something during the last year I&rsquo;ve thought for a while on the moving one day I would have to do and how much I would hate myself for that. It didn&rsquo;t make buy less.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7364/11342899124_b614ff504d_z.jpg" alt="Berlin is a bitch, and then you marry. Nice souvenir I bought in a shop in Kreuzberg" /></p>

<p>The good thing about this bookself is that it represents most of the things I&rsquo;ve done and places I&rsquo;ve visited during this year. It&rsquo;s not shown in the picture, but some Russian souvenirs live in the lowest shelf.</p>

<p>Kindles might be a perfect substitute for most of the books in the market, but I still believe there is nothing like paper when we talk about reference or programming books. Flipping pages >>> pressing buttons.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have time for writing more, there are a few bags that need to be filled with stuff. Wish me luck.</p>
