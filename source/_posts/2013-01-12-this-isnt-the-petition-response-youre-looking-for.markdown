[Funny request of start building a Death Star by 2016](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/secure-resources-and-funding-and-begin-construction-death-star-2016/wlfKzFkN "request") to the White House, but [unbeatable response to it](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/response/isnt-petition-response-youre-looking "response").

Just to summarize a bit, here are a few points in the response by the White House:

- To begin with, the official response title is "This Isn't the Petition Response You're Looking For". Superb.
- "The construction of the Death Star has been estimated to cost more than $850 quadrillion. We're working hard to reduce the deficit, not expand it."
- "The Administration does not support blowing up planets."
- "Why would we spend countless taxpayer dollars on a Death Star with a fundamental flaw that can be exploited by a one-man starship?"

But you should read [the whole thing](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/response/isnt-petition-response-youre-looking "response").

It kind of reminds me [the 404 pages I created for this blog](http://fuzzingtheweb.com/404/ "404") :)
