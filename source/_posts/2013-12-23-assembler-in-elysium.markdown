Funny moment when you are watching a science fiction movie and you realise a guy - William Fichtner - who is doing some work on his computer is actually programming assembler. Nice one, but taking into account the story is set in 2154, it seems a bit too much.

I just can't help stopping a movie I'm watching everytime I see a scene in which someone is typing something. I'm always looking forward to finding stuff like this.
