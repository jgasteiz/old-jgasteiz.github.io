This is the first post of this new stage of Fuzzing the Web. I've decided to give static blogs a go and I'll start using Octopress for it.

I'll write about the same random things I used to write about before, but I'll try to write better stuff.

Also, not all of the old content of Fuzzing the Web will be here. At the beginning, I'll make an effort to migrate my favourite blog posts, but they will be only a few. I'll keep migrating posts little by little, until one day I'll be done.

I'll also work hard on keeping all the content properly categorised.

Let's close this first post of this new blog with some _classic_ fun :)
