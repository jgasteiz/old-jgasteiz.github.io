It's been a _museums_ weekend and for the first time in months, we've had warm weather in London. Since yesterday. I might recover part of my natural tan before August!

And I also haven't touch a keyboard during the weekend, which is cool. It's been some kind of disconnection weekend, something I'm enjoying quite a lot lately. Anyway, I will probably compensate touching too much keyboard during this whole week, as usual.
