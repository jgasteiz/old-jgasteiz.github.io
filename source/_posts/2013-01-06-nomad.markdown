**Nomadic life**

It's been almost six years since I started living away from home and I've had the feeling of not belonging anywhere for all of these years. I've lived in seven or eight different places since then and I spend only a few weeks per year in Vitoria. I guess I don't want to belong anywhere. Someone could tell I am looking for something, moving this much, I don't know. I'll figure it out someday.

**Desert**

Furthermore, it's also related to the desert. The desert rock is the music genre Yawning Man invented back in the eighties-nineties. In terms of _desert_, it could describe most of the stuff I've had in my mind these last years: how I've behaved and felt with myself and most of the times with other people. The desert could be very warm during the day but it gets really cold at night. That's a close description of how I've been since I moved away from home. And somehow, the desert reminds loneliness too.

**Why now?**

[The first tattoo I've ever thought about](http://sp6.fotolog.com/photo/6/12/46/javitheskater/1212073336_f.jpg "ah") was six years ago, during my first months at university. I had the design completely worked out, but I never took a step forward and actually did it. And it's something I regret now. That one meant my adolescence, those amazing years in Vitoria with all my friends, partying and playing music. After moving to London, I knew I was closing another stage in my life and it felt like the right time for doing this.

**Conclusion**

This picture completely describes the last and closer stage in my life. I couldn't be comfortable with something which will try to describe the present or even the future. This is what it has been, not what it is or it will be.
