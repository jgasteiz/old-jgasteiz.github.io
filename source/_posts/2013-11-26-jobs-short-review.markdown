![Jobs, 2013](http://lh6.googleusercontent.com/zQvObkDlsk-J7_fDNZFw0qGRR69ngA0ggi0CEBl52_0=w519-h525-no)

The film was ok, but

- did anyone else had the feeling that Steve Jobs (and Jonathan Ive) got extremely caricatured? They looked more like programmed machines to follow one or two behaviours than humans! I still can't understand how Wozniak could put up with him for more than half of the movie.

- again, _Steve Jobs'_ way of facing problems seemed so unhuman. It's well known he was a "special" guy for not being the nicest boss / father ever, but I would feel quite offended if anyone pictured me in a film like this. I'd feel offended if he was my family or friend, I think.

- have they put all Apple commercials together as a script for Jonathan Ive's role? They made him look like a weirdo. Once more, I'd feel offended if I was him.

Apart from this, the film was fine. Entertaining, although I'd say it's not worthy paying much for watching it :/

I give it two thirds of a star out of two stars. Because weird roles deserve weird ratings.
