It's been today, after finishing some uni paperwork. I'm officially an engineer now, I can finally sing _the song_!

A 5-year part of my life has come to an end after signing this last documents. It's been nice, I won't say the opposite, but I'm also happy it came to an end. I have plenty of new and exciting stuff to experience now :)
